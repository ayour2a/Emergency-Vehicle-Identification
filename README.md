# Emergency-Vehicle-Identification

The ability to identify emergency vehicle aids, reducing any confusion in the event of an emergency. The task here is to classify emergence and non-emergence vehicles. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhisheksinghblr/emergency-vehiclesidentification?resource=download
I want to consider the following:
1. What steps should I consider prior to building the model?
2. What effect does increasing the number of layers have on the modelâ€™s performance and time?
3. Was there a case of overfitting in the model?
